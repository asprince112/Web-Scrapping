# Web-Scrapping

## Forum Scrapping

Web source : The Photo Forum, https://www.thephotoforum.com/

In the sbdirectory (Landscape & Cityscape), first you choose the target page you want to scrap, it will automatically filter out articles with more than 200 views in that page, then go through into each article to find the links of all photos, and combine with the title and the number of views, write into a new HTML file which is sorted by number of views.
